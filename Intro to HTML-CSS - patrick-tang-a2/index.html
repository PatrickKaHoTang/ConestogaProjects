			<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
			<p>This website consists of my top 10 favourite video games with images and video game footage.</p>
			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I have been an avid video gamer for most of my life.</p>
			<p>At a very young age, I started by playing console games such as NES, Game Boy, SNES, N64, Playstation, etc.  At this moment, I play computer games in the genres of MMORPGs, ARPGs, old console games from NES, SNES, Gameboy, N64, etc.</p>
			<p>Not only do I enjoy playing video games, I also enjoy watching them as well.  Specifically on Twitch, there is a community who speedruns video games.  This community is very exciting to watch as the members compete with each other in a friendly way to see who can beat the game as fast as possible.</p>
			<h2>Twitch Channels:</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/team/srl/">Twitch - Team SpeedRunsLive</a></p>
			<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/team/sda/">Twitch - Team SpeedDemosArchive</a></p>
			<p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/team/BestOfNES/">Twitch - Team Best of NES</a></p>
			<p>In addition, they also have two major charity events which last for a week that go on during the winter and the summer called "Awesome Games Done Quick" and "Summer Games Done Quick".  There is also other events that they have between those two specific dates.  In total as of Jan 2010, they have raised over $5,550,000 over the course of 5 years!</p><br>
			<p>I hope you enjoy your stay!</p><br>
			<p>Please leave any <a href="pages/feedback.html">feedback</a> if there is any issue with my website or if you think there needs to be some improvement!</p>
