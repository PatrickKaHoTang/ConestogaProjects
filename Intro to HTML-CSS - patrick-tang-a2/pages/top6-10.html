			<h3>Here are my top 6 to 10 favourite video games of all time!</h3>

			<h2>#6 - Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2</h2>
			<iframe width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnd0qg4I_MM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="caption">Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 has been a part of my life for at least 5 years when I first started playing video games online.  This game provides me great satisfaction when it comes to RTS games (Real Time Strategy) as I became one of the best players in Canada back in 2003.  The music is phenomenal and I still listen to those upbeat songs to this day.</p>

			<h2>#7 - Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</h2>
			<iframe width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xp20voR11gs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="caption">Countless hours, countless grinding sessions, countless hours of sleep lost before school...nothing better than Diablo II: Lord of Destruction!  I remember having so many ups and downs with this game.  Definitely one of the best ARPG's ever made for its time.  Diablo III came out almost a decade after; however, the game didn't have that type of feel like Diablo II did, it was still quite a great game to play!</p>

			<h2>#8 - Starcraft</h2>
			<iframe width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VsdKesdaKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="caption">Starcraft is one of my first games that I have ever played online.  The second I started playing, I got hooked instantly!  Although I haven't been playing any of the newer games that has been out, this is still one of my top 10 favourite games of all time.</p>

			<h2>#9 - The Legend of Zelda Series</h2>
			<iframe width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzRIGdGZgKU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="caption">The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest series ever made for Nintendo.  I still recall to this day the first time I started played this series and I still can't get enough of it!  My younger brother always wants me to play it to this day when I have some time for another nostaglia feel.</p>

			<h2>#10 - Chrono Trigger</h2>
			<iframe width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vqTZfknDVes" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p class="caption">This specific game is by far one of the best console RPG's I have ever played.  To this day, I play it once in awhile for that nostalgia feel when it comes to console games.  Since this game has been out, there has been no other game that tops this off.</p>
